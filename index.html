    <h1> Stat Simulator</h1>
    <p id=runtime></p>
    <p> This program was designed to help you find the probability of less than or equal to, equal to, or greater than X number of successes per N trials with a success rate of p over the course of S simulations.</p>
    <p> *You can enter the probability as a fraction or a decimal*</p>
    <p> For example, lets say you flip a coin 10 times. You want to know the chances that the coin will land on heads exactly four times. This program can help you find the probability of (x) heads with (n) flips per trial and (s) totoal simulations, assuming
        the chances of landing on heads (p) is 0.5 for each flip.</p>
    </p>
    <p><b>Please enter the # of successe (x) , the # of trials (n), the # of simulations(s), and the theoretical probability of success (p) in the following format: x, n, s, p </b></p>
